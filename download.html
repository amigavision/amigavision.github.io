		<p class="subtext">The AmigaVision team does <em>not</em> distribute software, we only maintain an <a href="https://github.com/amigavision/AmigaVision" style="color:white; text-decoration: underline">open source script</a> that builds a setup if you supply your own demos and&nbsp;games.</p>
    
		<p class="subtext"> We can point you to the search page of the software preservation section of archive.org, but note that anything available there is not built by&mdash;nor distributed by&mdash;the team, and the team has no responsibility for these&nbsp;files.</p>
