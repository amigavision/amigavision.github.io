We are happy to announce that the latest release of AmigaVision is available!

AmigaVision is the ultimate Amiga games & demo scene setup for MiSTer & Pocket FPGAs, emulators, and real Amiga hardware. Open source, community driven.

## ‚úÖ General Improvements

* This is a relatively small update, mostly to ensure that Sensible World of Soccer, in all its variants and editions, works properly.
* Added optional `MiSTer.ini` settings for 1440p displays. Note that these will not use the [5√óPAL Dynamic Crop](https://amiga.vision/5x), those are only active for 1080p and 4K displays.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Highlights

* [Sensible World of Soccer](https://sensiblesoccer.de) had several problems with loading tactics and English club teams in the past few releases. This has been fixed upstream, and you should now be able to play as Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne for Manchester City in the 2023/2024 season edition of SWOS!
* New June update of [Castlevania AGA](https://danteretrodev.itch.io/akumajou-dracula-aga), includes a music test menu and a new character sprite, as well as other fixes.
* Turrican 3 now supports the full set of CD32 buttons, making it much better to play with a gamepad ‚Äî if you played Mega Turrican or Super Turrican on the Mega Drive or Super Nintendo respectively, you should really check out this version!
* 8 games identified as running with the wrong settings, fixed.
* Game configurations are current with WHDLoad as of 2024-06-05.
