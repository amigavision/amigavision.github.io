title: AmigaVision Now the Best Amiga Gaming Experience on Raspberry Pi

We are happy to announce that the latest version of [AmigaVision] now has a supported and dedicated setup for the [Raspberry Pi]!

AmigaVision is the ultimate Amiga games & demo scene setup for MiSTer & Pocket FPGAs, Raspberry Pi + emulators — and Amiga 1200, 4000 & CD32.

To find out where to download pre-built packages, visit the [AmigaVision] site.

## 🥧 Raspberry Pi Support

The AmigaVision team always wanted to support [Raspberry Pi], but we were never happy with the input latency from controllers, audio latency in-game, and output latency via HDMI — and we also wanted easy ways to send the original output to analog CRTs.

Over the past few years, the author of RGB-Pi OS has been working on [RePlayOS], a custom Linux distribution that builds on libretro cores, but does not use RetroArch. It recently received its first public release, and we have been testing the development builds, with a special focus on Amiga latency and compatibility, and we worked with the author to:

* [Get Amiga audio latency down to 20-32ms (1-2 frames)](https://github.com/rtomasa/RePlay-issues/issues/56), depending on NTSC/PAL rendering — which is far lower than any other Raspberry Pi Amiga setup available today,
* Fix mouse behavior for [certain mice that were behaving erratically](https://github.com/rtomasa/RePlay-issues/issues/71) in Amiga games & Workbench,
* [Introduce exFAT as the default file system](https://github.com/rtomasa/RePlay-issues/issues/52), so you can use the full AmigaVision setup instead of a limited one.

With [RePlayOS], AmigaVision on Raspberry Pi comes as close as possible to being as low latency as a MiSTer FPGA — still our benchmark for input/output/audio latency — and also has great options for analog output via the RGB-Pi 2 adapter that converts HDMI to SCART RGB without any added latency, similar to MiSTer's Direct Video mode.

If you want to see more about how RePlayOS works, and some latency testing that proves that it delivers on its claims, check out this great video from Dreamroom64:

(Please note that he mentions some potential audio latency in this video using a preview build — we have since [worked with the author of RePlayOS to address this](https://github.com/rtomasa/RePlay-issues/issues/56), and it is no longer an issue.)

RePlayOS is now a fully supported platform for AmigaVision, and if you want the best Amiga gaming experience you can get on a Raspberry Pi, you should absolutely check it out. We have [documented the RePlayOS setup here] — it's essentially just a few file copies, super easy — and more improvements are coming.

Enjoy the best of what the Amiga platform has to offer, now fully supported with low latency and easy analog CRT output on Raspberry Pi!
