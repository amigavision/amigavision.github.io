title: Amiga CD³²
--- 

If you are unfamiliar with the Amiga CD³², it was essentially an Amiga 1200 with a 2× speed CD drive, packaged with gamepads and in a console form factor.

While the CD³² never really got its time to shine because of Commodore's bankruptcy soon after launch, there are some fun expansions of existing Amiga games with great CD audio and Full Motion Video intros, so some of its ~150 games are worth checking out.
