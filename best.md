title: Best Amiga Available in 2026
description: You’re interested in getting an Amiga for gaming and demo scene use in 2026. What's the best choice?
---

This comparison focuses on Amiga gaming and demo scene use in 2026, not nostalgia alone. Our criteria prioritize timing correctness, input/output latency, video and audio fidelity, and long-term practicality — as well as overall delight and fun.

Productivity software, AmigaOS “daily driving”, and historical collecting value are intentionally out of scope.

## Windows / Mac / Linux PC + Emulator

Running an Amiga emulator on a modern PC or Mac is the most accessible option on paper, but also the most variable in practice.

If you already own a suitable machine, the upfront cost can be low. If you are buying a small PC specifically for this purpose, the cost quickly approaches — or exceeds — better-performing alternatives.

The main drawbacks are complexity and consistency. Amiga emulators are powerful but notoriously difficult to configure correctly across a wide range of games and demos. Small differences in settings can have large effects on timing, audio, and compatibility.

There are also fundamental platform issues. On Windows and macOS, emulators do not automatically run 50 Hz PAL software at a true 50 Hz output rate. Since the majority of Amiga games were written for PAL systems, this results in uneven scrolling, [judder], or [tearing] that cannot be fully eliminated on those platforms. 

[Here’s a forum thread](https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php/showthread.php?t=67729) where both the author of WinUAE and the author of FS-UAE confirm that the standard PC/Mac 60 Hz refresh rate will cause stuttering when playing 50 Hz PAL Amiga games.

PC emulation can be an excellent tool for experimentation and development, but it is not the most reliable way to experience the Amiga as it actually behaved.

## TheA500 Mini *&* TheA1200

TheA500 Mini is an inexpensive, turn-key emulation box, but it is fundamentally limited by its hardware and software design.

It lacks the performance, timing accuracy, and output resolution[^10] for proper scaling required for serious Amiga use, particularly for demo scene productions and timing-sensitive games. As a result, it does not meet the accuracy, timing, and output requirements required for this comparison, and is therefore omitted from the table.

At the typical asking price, both MiSTer and Raspberry Pi–based solutions outperform it decisively in accuracy, latency, and flexibility.

As for TheA1200, no meaningful technical specifications have been published at the time of writing, so it is not possible to evaluate it yet.

## A600GS *&* A1200NG

These systems are modern Amiga-branded appliances built around software emulation rather than hardware recreation.

All three use UAE-derived emulation running on ARM or x86 hardware, wrapped in a custom Linux environment. While they offer a convenient turn-key experience and a nostalgic physical presentation, they do not provide cycle-accurate OCS/ECS/AGA behavior, deterministic raster timing, or native 50 Hz PAL output.

As with PC- and Raspberry Pi–based emulation, timing-sensitive games and a significant portion of the demo scene exhibit incorrect behavior, [tearing]/[judder], unstable raster effects, audio jitter, or inconsistent scrolling. Input and output latency are materially higher and less consistent than on FPGA-based platforms.

From a technical perspective, these systems are best understood as preconfigured emulation boxes rather than authentic Amiga implementations. They offer no meaningful accuracy or latency advantages over a well-configured Raspberry Pi 5, while costing substantially more and offering less flexibility.

Thus, they are considered irrelevant in this comparison.

## Vampire V4 FPGA *&* A6000

The Vampire V4 Standalone is best described as a modern, accelerated Amiga-compatible system, not a recreation of classic Amiga hardware.

It uses a custom FPGA chipset (SAGA) and a high-performance simulated 68080 CPU. While it is extremely fast, it does not reproduce OCS/ECS/AGA behavior or cycle-exact timing. Many demos and timing-sensitive effects either behave differently or fail outright.

The A6000 is essentially a Vampire V4 with an updated core + extra RAM, residing in a 3D printed case with keyboard.

As a result, Vampire V4 & A6000 are better viewed as “what-if next-generation Amigas” than preservation-accurate platforms, and are thus not relevant in this comparison.

(They are also very expensive, at ~$750 for the bare-bones V4, and ~$1200 for the A6000.)

## Raspberry Pi 5

The Raspberry Pi 5 represents the first Pi model that is genuinely fast enough to emulate the Amiga at acceptable speeds. This also includes its derivatives: Raspberry Pi 500, 500+ *&* CM5.

Note that “fast enough” here refers to raw CPU performance, not cycle accuracy or timing fidelity.

The hardware itself is relatively affordable, but a complete setup requires additional components: a power supply, case, storage, and often a USB hub. Earlier models (Pi 3 and Pi 4) are simply too slow to provide a consistently good Amiga experience and should be avoided.

Even on the Pi 5, emulation remains a compromise. While many games run well, timing accuracy, input latency, and CRT compatibility fall short of FPGA-based solutions. For casual gaming or WHDLoad-based setups, it can be a reasonable choice, but it is not ideal for cycle-exact demos or low-latency use.

## Real Amiga Hardware

A real Amiga remains the gold standard for historical authenticity.

There is no substitute for original hardware connected to a real CRT, with the original keyboard, mouse, and quirks intact. For collectors, preservationists, and those who value the physical experience as much as the software, real hardware is unmatched.

That authenticity comes at a cost. Well-maintained machines are expensive, and most systems require recapping and ongoing care. Meaningful upgrades — faster CPUs, more memory, and modern storage — add significantly to the total price.

Connecting a real Amiga to modern displays also requires additional hardware, such as scalers or video upgrades, which further increases complexity and cost.

For some users, those trade-offs are not downsides but *the point* — if you have the time and the money, why not? It can definitely be a fun and rewarding undertaking.

## MiSTer FPGA

MiSTer provides a hardware-accurate Amiga implementation without the practical downsides of aging electronics.

It delivers cycle-accurate behavior, extremely low and consistent input/output latency, correct PAL and NTSC timing, and support for both modern HDMI displays and native analog CRT output, even simultaneously. Power usage is low, and once configured, ongoing maintenance is minimal.

MiSTer’s deterministic timing and lack of external interference make it exceptionally reliable. In some cases, it is actually more consistent than real hardware due to the absence of component drift, power-supply variance, and third-party expansion interference.

Hardware options range from bare-bones boards to high-quality, purpose-built complete products like the SuperStation, which offers build quality far beyond typical single-board computer enclosures, with every display output option imaginable included.

## The Best Amiga in 2026 is…

The AmigaVision team owns and actively uses all of the platforms compared here. We maintain multiple real Amigas, several MiSTer setups with both HDMI and analog CRT outputs, Raspberry Pi–based emulation systems, and we regularly use Amiga emulators on Windows, macOS, and Linux. We maintain the AmigaVision setup for all of these platforms.

These conclusions are based on long-term, day-to-day use rather than theory.

Nothing fully replaces the feel and emotional impact of a real Amiga connected to a CRT, and original hardware will always be special.

But in 2026, the “best Amiga” is not just about authenticity — it is about accuracy *and* usability. Real hardware is expensive, complex, and increasingly fragile, which makes it difficult to recommend for most people.

For the majority of users, MiSTer offers the best balance: behavior that matches real hardware where it matters, combined with modern convenience, reliability, and low maintenance.

**If you want the most accurate, low-latency, low-maintenance, delightful and fun Amiga experience in 2026, MiSTer is the best choice for most users.**

[^1]: While emulators like WinUAE may be cycle accurate on paper, that doesn’t help when the host OS can interrupt the process at any time.

[^2]: On aging, analog hardware, you get capacitor drift, power rail fluctuations, clock stability variations with temperature, etc. An expanded Amiga introduces potential issues: Accelerators change bus contention behavior, and RTG cards, CF adapters, USB, etc. introduce side effects.

[^3]: Only on Linux. Windows and Mac emulators always run at 60hz, which causes tearing and stuttering when scrolling. It *is* possible to force your entire operating system to run at 50hz on some Windows computers, but the emulator can’t do it for you.

[^4]: Modern desktop operating systems have way too many variables to keep input and output latency low, e.g. host OS interruptions, USB latency and polling speed, graphics rendering pipelines, etc.

[^5]: If you add the  &#36;50 RGB-Pi 2 Adapter, it is possible, but it is not supported natively on the standard hardware setup, unlike a real Amiga or the MiSTer.

[^6]: Raspberry Pi 5 is ~$45-$95 (1GB vs. 8GB), PSU is ~15, case is $25, USB hub is $10, 64GB card is ~$20.

[^7]: A recapped (mandatory!) Amiga 1200 is ~$750 on US & UK eBay. Adding a faster CPU + RAM + HD runs you ~$320 (TerribleFire 1230 50MHz 64MB with IDE). It also needs a scaler or hardware upgrade to connect to HDMI, a good one is at least $100-150 — omitted from comparison.

[^8]: “Free” only if you plan on using your existing computer for emulation. A reasonably performant dedicated mini-PC for gaming in the living room is ~$250.

[^9]: MiSTer Pi board is $125 including case and 64GB SD card. SuperStation is $199 including 64GB SD card and a high-quality injection-molded case, much higher quality than the average affordable Raspberry Pi case.

[^10]: 1080p is the minimum resolution required for decent integer scaling of Amiga resolutions when the target is a modern 16:9 aspect ratio screen. TheA500 only supports 720p.
