## 💿 CD³² Support

This release of AmigaVision adds support for booting CD³² disc images (in `CHD` or `bin/cue` formats) on MiSTer directly from the launcher.

If you are unfamiliar with the CD³², it was essentially an Amiga 1200 with a 2× speed CD drive, packaged with gamepads and in a console form factor. While the CD³² never really got its time to shine because of Commodore's bankruptcy soon after launch, there are some fun expansions of existing Amiga games with great CD audio and Full Motion Video intros, so some of its 149 games are worth checking out. Some of our favorites:

* **Super Stardust** — Fun and extremely polished Asteroids-type game with an incredible tunnel shooter sections and a great CD soundtrack. We recommend using code `BZZZZZZZZZB` to go straight to the first tunnel level.
* **Superfrog** — Amiga's answer to Sonic the Hedgehog, a great little platformer with a great sense of speed. The CD³² version has a Full Motion Video cartoon intro.
* **Benefactor** — Puzzle platformer with a great CD soundtrack.
* **Beneath a Steel Sky** — One of the best adventure games that isn't a LucasArts game. Great CD soundtrack.

When upgrading AmigaVision, you should always replace all files (except your `Saves.hdf`) and `MiSTer.ini` settings when upgrading, and this release is no exception. Back up your existing files if you have custom settings, and re-apply them once everything is working.

If you already have a clean install of AmigaVision 2024.06.06 installed with its config files, the changes to support this are in `config/Amiga.cfg`, so make sure you at least copy this new file over to have CD support defined as a Secondary Master drive.

Once that is in place, you just select the disc image file from the MiSTer "Drives" menu, and you can start any CD³² disc from the launcher. You will need to supply your own disc images — we recommend `CHD` files for space efficiency and ease of navigation, but it supports `bin/cue` formats too.

Operating the CD³² launcher does require a keyboard, a mouse or an analog controller connected to your MiSTer, it cannot be operated from a gamepad/joystick.

Do note that while the majority of CD³² games work (and,  even a few CDTV games), this is using a shim combined with MiSTer's CD Audio support in the Amiga core, so not every game will work perfectly — but a good number of them do. Hopefully there will be a core with dedicated CD³²  support available in the future.

We maintain a [CD32 on MiSTer compatibility spreadsheet] along with any special settings needed for games, do leave comments there or in the [issue tracker] if you have figured out how to get a non-working game working! 

Note that the Amiga core on Analogue Pocket does not have CD-ROM support (yet?), so this feature is only for MiSTer at the moment.
