title: AmigaVision Setup
--- 

AmigaVision creates a carefully curated collection of Amiga games and demos, as well as a minimal Workbench setup with useful utilities and apps, and wraps it all in a user-friendly launcher.

It has many features specifically for use with [MiSTer] FPGA devices, but also aims to work with emulators like UAE and on original AGA-compatible hardware like an Amiga 1200/4000 or CD32, usually with SD/CF card adapters.

Its aim is to balance preservation of the historical and current output of the Amiga games and [demo scene] as accurately as possible, while still being easy to use for people new to the Amiga computer.

## Features

* Sophisticated and performant Amiga games and demo launcher with screenshots included, can be entirely controlled using gamepads, joysticks or via keyboard. This lets you quickly and easily experience the best of what the system has to offer.

* Close to 2000 hand-tuned, per-game 5× integer scaling with Dynamic Crop settings, ensuring that games and demos make the best use of modern 1080p and 4K 16:9 displays without leaving large parts of the screen blank.

* Carefully curated and well-tested settings for games and demos, no duplication of AGA and ECS versions, with lots of genre and top lists to help you navigate the massive amount of Amiga games available. We take special care to run every game at the correct aspect ratio and CPU speed.

* Games are configured to run in their correct modes, games created in Europe use PAL with 5× Dynamic Crop where appropriate, whereas US-made games run in NTSC for the correct aspect ratio and CPU speed. You can optionally override this in the settings.

* Includes key productions from the legendary Amiga demo scene, including disk magazines sorted chronologically, making it a great companion to explore the demo scene's [UNESCO-nominated] cultural heritage artifacts.

* Hand-tuned scanline and shadow mask settings to get you close to that original CRT look if you are using it on a modern flat panel display. Of course, the setup also works with analog output to real CRT displays.

* Shared file system support for the `MiSTer:` volume, making it trivial to transfer files to and from the Amiga over WiFi or wired networks, or directly using the SD card.

* Minimalist Workbench setup with support for including your own custom set of configurations, games, applications and files using the `Saves:` HD image that will survive upgrades of the main HD image.

* RTG resolution support for running Workbench in modern resolutions like 1920×1080 and in 16:9 aspect ratios on MiSTer.

* Uses PFS as its file system to avoid accidental corruption on write operations, which the standard FFS file system is very prone to.

* Includes a dedicated setup to closely mimic a stock Amiga 500 with memory expansion (for use with ADF files only) for maximum compatibility with demo scene productions and any troublesome games that rely on cycle accuracy and exact hardware timings.

* Includes an optional, dedicated Amiga 500HD setup that gives you a representative feel for how it was to use Workbench 1.3 with a hard disk and productivity apps around 1989.

* Includes an optional, dedicated Amiga 600HD setup that gives you a representative feel for how it was to use Workbench 2.x with an Amiga 600 or 3000 and productivity apps around 1991-1992.


## Quick Setup for MiSTer

**Note:** If you are updating from an earlier version -- especially before 2023 -- we *highly* recommend setting aside your `games/Amiga/MegaAGS-Saves.hdf` file and doing this installation from scratch and then adding that file back in, as many things have changed. This is generally always the best approach when upgrading.

* Copy the contents of the following directories to the corresponding directories in the top level on MiSTer's file system:

```  
_Computer
config
Filters
games
Presets
Shadow_Masks

```

* Paste the following recommended core settings to the bottom of your `MiSTer.ini` file in the root of your MiSTer file system -- these settings are further explained in the Video Modes section. It's especially important to explicity define resolutions for both PAL and NTSC, and not rely on the automatic fallback that MiSTer has available:

```
[Amiga]
video_mode_ntsc=8
video_mode_pal=9
vsync_adjust=1 ; You can set this to 2 if your display can handle it
custom_aspect_ratio_1=40:27
bootscreen=0

[Amiga500]
video_mode_ntsc=8
video_mode_pal=9
vsync_adjust=1 ; You can set this to 2 if your display can handle it
custom_aspect_ratio_1=40:27
bootscreen=0

[Amiga500HD]
video_mode_ntsc=8
video_mode_pal=9
vsync_adjust=1 ; You can set this to 2 if your display can handle it
custom_aspect_ratio_1=40:27
bootscreen=0

[Amiga600HD]
video_mode_ntsc=8
video_mode_pal=9
vsync_adjust=1 ; You can set this to 2 if your display can handle it
custom_aspect_ratio_1=40:27
bootscreen=0
```

* Reboot your MiSTer, you should now have two entries in the `Computer` section: 
  * `Amiga` for the main AmigaVision setup -- you'll be using this one 99% of the time.
  * `Amiga 500` for a stock Amiga 500 hardware setup with no hard drive to use with ADF floppy disk images for any troublesome demos or games that don't work with the main setup. Some demo ADFs are included and can be mounted as floppy disks in MiSTer's OSD menu, invoked with the `F12` key.

* Launch the `Amiga` entry and enjoy! Don't forget to check out the sections below -- especially on save files, controller mappings and video modes once the basic setup is up and running.

## Optional Setups for MiSTer

(You can probably skip this section if you were not an Amiga user back in the day or unless you have a special interest in computing history :)

If you used the Amiga back in the day, you may have memories of using an Amiga 500 with a hard disk and Workbench 1.3, or maybe an Amiga 600 or 3000 with Workbench 2.x. We have included dedicated and separate setups for these in the included `MegaAGS-Extras` archive.

* Copy the contents of `Amiga 500 HD Setup` and/or `Amiga 600 HD Setup` to their respective directories on the MiSTer
* You will now have separate `Amiga 500HD` and/or `Amiga600HD` launch items in the `Computer` section. These are fully configured to support shared drives, PFS file systems (even on 1.3!), RTC clock, etc.

There are `ReadMe` files that go into more detail about these setups.

These are *not* meant to be used for games or demos, but instead for giving you a basic setup that lets you run productivity apps like you did back in the day. For games and demos, we recommend the `Amiga` (main AmigaVision setup) and `Amiga 500` (for use with ADF files) instead.

## Gamepad & Joystick Mapping for MiSTer

While many games supports two or more buttons, Amiga games were generally designed for one button joysticks. Consequently "up to jump" (or accelerate) control scheme is very common. If you are using a gamepad, you might want to use MiSTer's controller mapping to bind the up direction to the D-pad and/or an dedicated jump/accelerate button, typically the `X` button. Here's how:

* First, make sure to have CD32 controller mode enabled (this is the default).
* Enter "Define joystick buttons" mode
* Map directions as usual
* Map the first three buttons (red, blue and yellow) to `A`, `B` and `Y`.
* The fourth button (green) is practically never used, and can be mapped to `Select`, `R2/ZL` or similar -- or skipped altogether.
* Go ahead and map right/left triggers and play/pause.
* When asked to if you want to "setup alternative buttons", say Yes!
* Skip all choices except "up", which we recommend mapping to `X`.

While a keyboard and mouse isn't strictly necessary to play most action games, it is definitely recommended for the full Amiga experience, and many games have controls that make use of them.


## Save Files

**IMPORTANT:** For games with save functionality you **MUST** quit the game using the `DEL` key for the save data to be written to "disk", and thus the SD card. You *will* lose your save games if you don't exit the game *after* also saving in-game! 

In the `[Options]` menu of the launcher you can choose between a few alternative quit key options if the `DEL` key doesn't work for you. If set, it will override the preconfigured default Quit key. The active Quit key is displayed on the splash screen shown when a game is loading.

## Video Modes

The optimal `vsync_adjust` setting in `MiSTer.ini` will depend on your HDMI display. A setting of `2` ensures the lowest possible latency, but it may come at the cost of a short period of no video or audio on video mode changes -- something Amiga games and demos do quite often. Setting `vsync_adjust` to `1` introduces a buffer that will smooth over most of these changes, although it will add a frame of latency.

A unique feature of the Amiga (Minimig) core on MiSTer is the ability to do viewport cropping. By default the full overscan area will be fed to the HDMI scaler, resulting in huge borders for most content. But fear not! AmigaVision leverages the custom `vadjust` feature of the core to dynamically apply viewport settings on a per-game basis. This depends on MiSTer's "shared folder" functionality, which is enabled in AmigaVision if the "games/Amiga/shared" directory exists. So, make sure you copied all the archive contents as described in the Setup section.

Also note that the dynamic cropping *only* applies if you are using 1080p output. Most Amiga games fit on the screen using 5× zoom in this resolution. Any other resolution or analog output is *not* affected by dynamic viewport cropping, as it only makes sense for 1080p/4K 16:9 displays.

With dynamic vadjust enabled, most titles will enjoy a nicely centered viewport at a perfect 5× scale using 1080p output resolution, by cropping the viewport to 216 lines. Games using more than 216 active video lines will instead get a perfect 4× scale by applying a 270 line crop.

Next, let's talk about Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR). Most Amiga graphics were drawn targeting a roughly square pixel display, if considering standard low resolution mode in PAL. However, some American games were drawn using the 320x200px NTSC mode stretched to cover a 4:3 display, yielding distinctly narrower pixels. Using MiSTer's capability for setting up custom aspect ratios, it is possible to quickly toggle between these PARs via OSD -> Audio & Video -> Aspect ratio. When you add the `custom_aspect_ratio` override to `MiSTer.ini` as specified in the setup section, you will be able to toggle between `Original` and `40:27` settings (as well as the fully useless `Full screen` setting, please don't use this).

`Original` will yield square pixels for full-height PAL titles, and the sometimes correct narrow pixels for NTSC games. `40:27` will result in square pixels for PAL (5×) titles and NTSC/PAL60 titles. As guidance, use these settings depending on what video mode the launcher UI denotes in the info section for the game for best results:

```
4×PAL      Original
5×PAL      40:27
5×PAL60    40:27
5×NTSC     Original (or occasionally 40:27, depending on title)

```

Generally, if you leave it on the default setting (`40:27`), most popular Amiga games will appear in the correct aspect ratio. Exceptions are US-produced games like e.g. Defender of the Crown, which were made using the narrower NTSC resolutions.

Again, make sure to add the Minimig core overrides in MiSTer.ini as specified in the setup section to enjoy the best HDMI output possible, and make sure you have set MiSTer to output in 1080p resolution.

## CPU Performance Notes

The D-Cache option in MiSTer's Amiga core is essentially a turbo switch for the CPU, making it perform on par with an accelerated Amiga with a Motorola 68030 CPU at 50MHz in many benchmarks. Unfortunately, running with it enabled introduces lots of subtle glitches in many (mostly older) games and demos, so it's recommended is to leave it *OFF* by default.

The CPU D-Cache option is available in the `OSD` under the `System` menu.

On the other hand, some titles -- mostly 3D polygon games and demos -- will benefit greatly from the CPU boost D-Cache offers. So it's an option worth experimenting with on a case by case basis.

Note that the glitches introduced with D-Cache on can sometimes clear up by turning it off while the Amiga core is running. Other times they seem to stick until reboot. The latter behavior is the case with, for example, Turrican II and Grand Monster Slam (and many less significant titles). Whenever making changes to the System settings in the OSD, we recommend re-loading the core.


## Workbench

From the launcher, you can hit the `ESC` key to exit into Workbench, the AmigaOS graphical desktop environment.

You can explore the world's first multitasking 16-bit computer from 1985 with the addition of a more modern desktop from 1992, AmigaOS 3.

To change from the default 640×200 resolution to something like 1280×720 or 1920×1080 for use with a 16:9 HD display, hold down the right mouse button and select your preferred resolution from the ScreenMode menu. 540p is a nice compromise, a very usable screen resolution that doubles every pixel on a modern 1080p/4K 16:9 display.


## Non-working Games

About 10 games are currently not working due to CPU or graphics chipset features not yet implemented in MiSTer's Minimig core. Over the past years compatibility has improved a lot, and that trend is likely to continue. A few titles do not work, or are very glitchy, due to other inaccuracies. This will also likely improve over time. The launcher will specify when a game is known not to work in the `Notes` section of a given game.


## Custom Scripts

If you want to run additional scripts on startup, AmigaVision looks for a file named `Saves:custom-startup` on boot and runs it, so if you need to run scripts that will survive upgrades of the main image, this is where to put them.

As an example, here's what you would add to `Saves:custom-startup` if you wanted to make changes to screen resolution, colors, pointers or any other Workbench setting copied from `ENV:Sys/` (which is where Workbench settings are stored temporarily) to `Saves:Custom/Prefs-Env/` before rebooting:

```
copy >NIL: Saves:Custom/Prefs-Env ENV:Sys/

```

This will take the setting you copied to `Saves:Custom/Prefs-Env` and put them in RAM: when booting the image, so you can keep your own settings even when replacing the `MegaAGS.hdf` file with a future version. You can also install new apps/games to Saves: and add `Assign` statements etc to the `Saves:` drive, or do anything else you want to keep permanent after upgrading.

## Found Bugs? Want to Request Features?

While AmigaVision has been tested for many years, the sheer volume of games and demos makes it all but certain that something has been overlooked somewhere. If you find something that doesn't work or seems like it's running with the wrong settings, or something is missing -- tell us about it in the issue tracker at https://amiga.vision.

## Troubleshooting

### I get a bunch of errors when starting up!

Unfortunately, there's a lot of variables in what could go wrong, but one useful thing to verify is to make sure the `HDF` file didn't get corrupted on its way to the MiSTer. It's a large file, and there's a lot that can go wrong along the way. The reasons for this happening are legion, but among them:

* You are using FTP to transfer the file, but your FTP client defaults to ASCII instead of binary transfers.
* You are using SMB/Samba, but the implementation of your OS isn't great, and might abort mid-write.
* Your SD card has issues writing the file — very common with cheap or old SD cards.

Let's make sure the image made it over to the MiSTer intact.

The easiest — but a little bit time-consuming, since the DE-10 nano doesn't have the fastest CPU — is to compare SHA-1 checksums. MiSTer, Windows, Mac and Linux all have these tools installed by default, but you have to issue some command line instructions to make it work.

1. Do a new, clean transfer of the `HDF` file to MiSTer — ideally not over the network, but if that's your only option, go for it. The reason why you need to do this again is that if the Amiga does any writes to the `HDF` during earlier attempts to launch it, the checksum will be different, and useless for this purpose.
2. Do a clean boot of your MiSTer, and press the `F9` key on a keyboard connected to it. This will let you log in to the terminal. Username is `root`, and password is `1` unless you have changed it in the past.
3. Run the following command, which will take 5-10 minutes to complete: `shasum /media/fat/games/Amiga/MegaAGS.hdf`
4. It will report back a checksum, you will compare this to the checksum on your computer.

Depending on what operating system you are on, you will do one of the following:

* **If you are on macOS:** Open the Terminal, and run the command: `shasum /path/to/MegaAGS.hdf`. Compare this to the checksum you got on the MiSTer.

* **If you are on Windows:** Open PowerShell, and run the command: `Get-FileHash C:\path\to\MegaAGS.hdf -Algorithm SHA1`. Compare this to the checksum you got on the MiSTer.

* **If you are on Linux:** Open a terminal, and run the command: `shasum /path/to/MegaAGS.hdf`. Compare this to the checksum you got on the MiSTer.

If these checksums do not match, something is wrong with either the way you transfer your file, or your SD card. 

If they do match, launching should work without issues, assuming you don't have a bad `HDF` file on your computer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does the `Minimig` entry do now that I have an `Amiga` setup?

We use the `Amiga` and `Amiga 500` MGL files to launch the Minimig core with  dedicated configurations. The Minimig entry isn't used directly anymore. Just ignore the Minimig entry or rename it using your own [names.txt] if you want. You can also use this core for Amiga setups unrelated to MegaAGS.

This also lets us have the `Amiga 500HD` and `Amiga 600HD` setups with separate hard disk images, shared files directory, etc.

We find this to be a more usable and cleaner setup, instead of using the core configuration selectors that cannot be named, and lets you have e.g. the Amiga 500 setup easily available on the top level for use with demos and games that do not work on a "modern" Amiga HD-based setup.

### Why are there two `Amiga` entries in my menu?

If you are using the `update_all` script, it may download a file called `names.txt` that renames the "Minimig" core to "Amiga". You can edit this file in the root of your MiSTer filesystem to be "Commodore Amiga", or remove it if you are fine with it being called "Minimig". See also the previous question for why we chose this setup.

If you absollutely want to avoid having a separate "Minimig" entry altogether, some people rename the config files from the Amiga 500 setup to be Minimig instead, and move the HDF into the Amiga folder, and then name the Minimig core "Amiga 500" in `names.txt`.

### Why do you have Scanline and Shadow Mask presets by default?

The Amiga was almost exclusively used with RGB-based CRTs or consumer TVs, and graphics do not look correct without scanlines and shadow masks. We have included a set of Amiga-specific scanline and shadow mask setups for use with MiSTer to more accurately represent the graphics output of the system that we highly recommend.

Thus, the default setup is configured for this to make sure the most people see the most representative setup. Since configuring this can be intimidating to new users, we chose to have a default that we think best represents the Amiga's original look.

You can of course set your own scanline and shadow mask presets in MiSTer's menus and save those configurations if you don't want to use ours. 

If you are using resolutions lower than 1080p, 1440p or 1536p, we recommend turning them off, but since most MiSTer users are on 1080p/4K TVs (or analog CRTs), they are on by default.

### Should I worry about Amiga viruses?

In short: No. 

Viruses on the Amiga were quite common, and some retail games even shipped with infected disks in the box. 

Even though we don't control what's being used as inputs to the script that creates the AmigaVision image, pretty much all games and demos run inside WHDL containers, you can think of them as "virtualization for the Amiga". Their job is to insulate the game from the rest of the system, reset CPU vectors, and other system state preservation. So even if a game or demo contains a virus, it cannot stay resident in memory, and will not spread to the rest of the system outside of the sandbox it has been given.

If you want to check the state of a given setup, or whether you have viruses in memory, just run the included VirusZ scanner in the System folder. Again, if you see virus warnings inside of WHDLoad containers, it's nothing to worry about.

We check all files that are under our control for viruses before release.

### Does AmigaVision work with Kickstart 3.2?

While the standard AmigaVision setup expects Kickstart 3.1 — which was the last release from Commodore — we have had reports of it working if you replace `icon.library` and `workbench.library` with their respective Workbench 3.2 versions. The recommended and tested setup is still Kickstart 3.1.

### I can't get the game started from its title screen! Do I ever need to use "Joystick Swap"?

Unless you are using the "Arcadia Systems" games (see below), no. On the Commodore 64, games sometimes used Port 1 and sometimes Port 2 for controlling games, necessitating this setting; but since the (Commodore) Amiga shipped with a mouse and it was always plugged into port 1, the main controller is pretty much always connected to port 2. 

The MiSTer core will handle these mappings for you, and joystick port configuration is pretty much never the reason you can't start or control a given game. It's way more likely that you have to hit the space bar, F1, or click a mouse button to get the game started. If you're stuck, look up the controls for a given game in an online manual -- which is always a good idea anyway, as there are often additional keyboard or mouse controls needed for a given game for full enjoyment.

### What's "Arcadia Systems"?

Arcadia was an unsuccessful venture by Mastertronic to create an Amiga 500 based multi-game arcade system. Most titles released for the system have been dumped and are available on the AmigaVision image. The games are not great (to put it kindly), but are an interesting curiosity.

Button mapping:

```
P1 Start:    F1
P2 Start:    F2
Left Coin:   F3
Right Coin:  F4
Config:      F5

```

Player 1 uses joystick port 1, while Amiga software universally expect mouse in port 1 and joystick in port 2. If using only one joystick, enable the "Joy Swap" option in the Chipset menu to route the first MiSTer joypad to port 1. It's also worth noting that all Arcadia games make use of a 2-button joystick.
