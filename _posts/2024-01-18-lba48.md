It’s time to upgrade your Analogue Pocket Amiga core! 

The latest version now supports full AmigaVision setups up to 2TB, no need for a slimmed-down <4GB setup anymore.

Note that it *requires* the latest 2.1 firmware from Analogue, and will look for `MegaAGS.hdf`, not the Pocket-specific file.

Also new in the latest Amiga core release for the Pocket: 

* Audio mixing has been added, no more fully separated stereo, especially nice for headphone use.
* Additional ICache fixes will let games that previously didn’t run on the Pocket work, it should be at parity with MiSTer now.
