title: Amiga Core for Analogue Pocket Updated to Support Latest AmigaVision
published: true
---

Just a quick note to let you know that the [Amiga core for Analogue Pocket] has been updated to support the latest version of AmigaVision. No huge changes, but you now no longer have to rename the HDF files to the old file names, it should work out of the box. The [documentation] has been updated to reflect this.

Additionally, we updated the UI labels in the core menus to more clearly explain what they do, and there is also a fix to the scoreboard corruption in the game Hybris, contributed by rsn8887.

If you have an existing installation of AmigaVision, you need to rename the HDFs and ROM files to AmigaVision instead of MegaAGS, i.e.

* `MegaAGS.hdf` → `AmigaVision.hdf`
* `MegaAGS-Saves.hdf` → `AmigaVision-Saves.hdf`
* `MegaAGS.rom` → `AmigaVision.rom`

If you are doing a clean install of AmigaVision on the newly updated [Amiga core for Analogue Pocket], you don't have to do anything outside of copying the files, as specified in the [documentation].

Enjoy the best of what the Amiga platform has to offer, now in handheld form!
