We are happy to announce that the latest release of AmigaVision is available!

AmigaVision is the ultimate, open source Amiga game and demo scene setup for MiSTer and Analogue Pocket FPGAs, emulators, and real hardware.


## ‚úÖ General Improvements

* For [historical reasons](https://misterfpga.org/viewtopic.php?p=83118#p83118), AmigaVision (then known as MegaAGS) had a number of PAL games running at what is called "PAL60" ‚Äî meaning, they would have the pixel aspect ratio of PAL, but would run at 60hz and 5√ó scale. This was before MiSTer supported 5√óPAL scaling (which we implemented support for), so now that we have control of both the scaling and cropping, we can make these run at PAL settings again ‚Äî so, we did.
* This means we [changed 543 games from PAL60 to PAL](https://github.com/amigavision/AmigaVision/commit/062da0505ed7f5cd95a0883c504e8ae6e12a99ac), and 5√ó scaling offsets have been added for MiSTer. If you prefer running these games in 60hz (shooters especially), you can still do that by going to `Options` ‚Üí `Force NTSC`. Please help us test these games, and report bugs if the scaling/cropping is not correct on a given game.
* To solve issues with [Super Hi-Res sprites](https://github.com/amigavision/AmigaVision/issues/158), 28MHz is now the new default pixel clock ‚Äî which means **it is extra important that you update the `Amiga.cfg` file and `MiSTer.ini` settings if you are upgrading**. You should always replace all files (except your `Saves.hdf`) and `.ini` settings when upgrading, and this release is no exception. Back up your existing files if you have custom settings, and re-apply them once everything is working.

## üïπÔ∏è Game *&* Demo Highlights

* We have included some of the best demos from last week's Revision 2024 demo party ‚Äî check out `Demos by Year ‚Üí 2024` to see what's going on in the Amiga demo scene these days.
* Two of the Revision 2024 demos are also 16:9 aspect ratio compatible on MiSTer, without stretching any pixels. To view:
  * Go to the `Demos ‚Üí Widescreen` category.
  * Open MiSTer's OSD menu, and under Video/Audio options, select "Full Screen".
  * Start any of the demos in the `Widescreen` section ‚Äî  "Deep Meet" was this year's #1 demo at Revision, and "Paint" by Melon Design is another demo from revision that looks great in 16:9. But while you are in there, check out the other widescreen demos too! (This assumes your TV/monitor is actually 16:9 ;)
  * (And don't forget to switch it back to `40:27` after you are done with the 16:9 demos ‚Äî or just re-load the core)
* "Dune" is now running the [canonical NTSC version](https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=2658) with the taller "Sachs" NTSC pixel aspect ratio ‚Äî your planets are again perfectly round!
* "Powerglove Reloaded" isn't a completely new game, but still is not as well-known as it should be ‚Äî give it a try!
* "Ports of Call" now has configurations available for German and French.
* "ViroCop" no longer has critical parts of the score/power display cut off.
* Sensible Soccer 2023/2024 season version added! Play as your favorite team with correct names for the players!
* Super Street Fighter II DX has received a descriptive label to make it obvious that it's the improved version.
* Several classic demo scene productions are now available to run from hard disk; some highly recommended favorites:
  * Batman Rises
  * De Profundis
* Game configurations are current with WHDLoad as of 2024-04-03.

## üß© Integrations

While not being part of the release itself, it's worth pointing out that both of the excellent [TapTo NFC card loader](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/tapto) and [Super Attract Mode](https://github.com/mrchrisster/MiSTer_SAM) projects support AmigaVision now. Thank you to everyone involved!

## üõ†Ô∏è Stay Updated *&* Help Us Make AmigaVision Even Better

If you find any bugs or settings that need improvements, file a ticket on the [AmigaVision] web site. Especially if you can help test the new 5√óPAL scale and crop settings for the [543 games we just changed from PAL60 to PAL](https://github.com/amigavision/AmigaVision/commit/062da0505ed7f5cd95a0883c504e8ae6e12a99ac), that would be highly appreciated.
