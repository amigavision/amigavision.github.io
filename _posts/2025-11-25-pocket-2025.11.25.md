title: Amiga Core for Analogue Pocket Updated to Support Latest AmigaVision
published: true
---

Just a quick note to let you know that the [Amiga core for Analogue Pocket] has been updated to support the latest version of AmigaVision. No huge changes, but you now no longer have to rename the HDF files to the old file names, it should work out of the box. The [documentation] has been updated to reflect this.

Other fixes included in the 0.2.3 release of the Pocket core:

* Hybris scoreboard graphics issue fixed, ported from the MiSTer core by rsn8887.
* Menu label cleanup.
* Recent MiSTer improvements by robinsonb5 ported to the core by rsn8887, thanks! This fixes audio in Pit-Fighter, Torvak the Warrior, Risky Woods. Also fixes issues in Nexus 7, Roots 2.0, and Domination demos.

If you have an existing installation of AmigaVision, you need to rename the HDFs and ROM files to AmigaVision instead of MegaAGS, i.e.

* `MegaAGS.hdf` → `AmigaVision.hdf`
* `MegaAGS-Saves.hdf` → `AmigaVision-Saves.hdf`
* `MegaAGS.rom` → `AmigaVision.rom`

If you are doing a clean install of AmigaVision on the newly updated [Amiga core for Analogue Pocket], you don't have to do anything outside of copying the files, as specified in the [documentation].
