title: AmigaVision (MegaAGS) 2023.07.17 Released with Improved Launcher Reliability
published: true
---

We are happy to announce that the latest release of AmigaVision/MegaAGS is available!

AmigaVision is the ultimate Amiga games & demo scene setup for MiSTer & Pocket FPGAs, Raspberry Pi + emulators — and Amiga 1200, 4000 & CD32.

To find out where to download pre-built packages, visit the [AmigaVision](https://amiga.vision) site.

This is a very minor update to the recent major [2023.06.06 release] that focuses on improving reliability of loading thumbnail previews in the game/demo launcher, as well as some updates to WHDLoad configurations. 

* More reliable loading of thumbnail previews in the launcher when returning from a previously loaded game or demo. This was especially noticable in the Pocket variant, since that device has slower disk access.
* Zine 11 disk magazine now works.
* Disambiguation between multiple versions of the same game (e.g. ECS vs AGA) in titles ended up accidentally listing them with a language code instead. This has been fixed.
